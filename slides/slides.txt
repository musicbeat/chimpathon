|                               what do you mean "not so easy?"              |
|                              all you do is just create an XML template     |
|                               with your favorite editor, and then you      |
|                            just create an XSLT script to merge the data    |
|                              into your message, and then you just go to    |
|                                gcmadmin and you paste the XML into one     |
|                                 field and the XSLT into another field.     |
|                              and you're good to go. unless there's a       |
|                                   bug in your XSLT or you need to add      |
|                                something to your XML. then you just        |
|                                         start over.                        |

|      "Simple Email Service"          In the Verify a New Domain dialog box,|
|                                          you will see a Domain Verification|
|                                       Record Set containing a Name, a Type,|
|                                         and a Value. (This information will|
|                                           also be available by clicking the|
|                                      domain name after you close the dialog|
|                                                                       box.)|

|                                      To complete domain verification, add a|
|                                TXT record with the displayed Name and Value|
|                                to your domain's DNS server. For information|
|                                    about Amazon SES TXT records and general|
|                                   guidance about how to add a TXT record to|
|                                         a DNS server, see Amazon SES Domain|
|                                    Verification TXT Records. In particular:|
|                             If your DNS provider does not allow underscores|
|                     in record names, you can omit _amazonses from the Name.|
|                                                                            |
|                                     To help you easily identify this record|
|                                  within your domain's DNS settings, you can|
|                                 optionally prefix the Value with amazonses:|
|                                                                            |
|                                     Some DNS providers automatically append|
|                               the domain name to DNS record names. To avoid|
|                               duplication of the domain name, you can add a|
|                             period to the end of the domain name in the DNS|
|                              record. This indicates that the record name is|
|                                   fully qualified and the DNS provider need|
|                                       not append an additional domain name.|
|                                                                            |

|   well, that was easy - right.                                             |
|   but how do i do templates for                                            |
|   my email?                                                                |

|   oh. right. templates aren't simple                                       |
|   so they're not part of AWS SES.                                          |
